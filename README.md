# Spam Filter

`spam-filter` is a program written for an AI class (CSC 425 at NKU) for our second project. For this project, we implemented multinomial, gaussian, and bernoulli naive bayesian models.

## Execution

Run `python ./main.py`. The output is going to be the accuracy of predictions for each of the models.

## Testing

To test simply execute `python -m unittest discover`. This should cover all the tests you will ever need
